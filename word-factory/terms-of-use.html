    <h1 class="main-title">Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p class="single-content">
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
      you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
      using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of
      the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
      extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
      translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
      app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Word Factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Word Factory is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
      efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
      changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
      reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
      making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Word Factory app stores and processes personal data that you have
      provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility
      to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
      that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
      removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
      operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
      malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
      features and it could mean that the Word Factory app won’t work properly
      or at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and
      Conditions.

    <p>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that Word Factory will
      not take responsibility for. All functions of the app will require the app
      to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
      provided by your mobile network provider, but Word Factory cannot take
      responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
      have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
      that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
      still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
      the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
      app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
      use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
      without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
      device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
      you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
      available on Android – the requirements for system(and for any additional
      systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
      and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Word Factory does not promise t­hat it will always update the app so that
      it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have
      installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to
      the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing
      the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
      termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
      (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
      you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>

      We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are
      advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify
      you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

    <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-01-29</p>
