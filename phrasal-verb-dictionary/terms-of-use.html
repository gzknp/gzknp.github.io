    <h1 class="main-title">Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p class="single-content">
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
      you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
      using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of
      the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
      extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
      translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
      app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Bright Tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright Tech is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
      efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
      changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
      reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
      making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phrasal Verb Dictionary app doesn't store or processes personal data.
      It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
      We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which
      is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
      by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
      vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
      security features and it could mean that the Phrasal Verb Dictionary app
      won’t work properly or at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and
      Conditions.
    </p>

      Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the
      app:

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
      available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional
      systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
      and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright Tech does not promise t­hat it will always update the app so that
      it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have
      installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to
      the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing
      the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
      termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
      (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b)
      you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
